# Hi, I'm Yang Fan!

![](images/profile.jpg)

I'm a graduate student studying Education Management. I'm from Sichuan province, which locates in the southwest of China. The reason why I choose this major is because I'm an English teacher working in a Chinese college. And my undergraduate major is English Translation. 

I love English and also love to be a teacher.

## Education Experience

During my undergraduate years, I studied in the English Translation major, embarking on a journey of in-depth exploration of knowledge.

The curriculum was diverse and elaborate. From basic English-Chinese and Chinese-English translation courses that strengthened my skills in text conversion to consecutive interpretation and simultaneous interpretation courses which challenged me to achieve instant language transformation, I made solid progress every step of the way.

In terms of academic practice, I actively participated in various projects. I once joined the translation volunteer team for an international academic conference organized by our school and was responsible for consecutive interpretation during expert lectures. 

Thanks to professional training, I have mastered translation software like Trados proficiently, which empowers me to carry out efficient and high-quality translation work. This learning experience has shaped me into a professional with solid skills nowadays.
